## Project outline

This project presents a comprehensive natural language processing pipeline for multi-label classification and analysis of disaster response messages. Using the publicly available Disaster Response Messages dataset. A range of traditional and deep learning models were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in handling short, noisy, and imbalanced textual data. Classical linear models such as Logistic Regression and LinearSVC trained on TF-IDF and BoW representations demonstrated good baseline performance, achieving macro-F1 scores around 0.40–0.45 in multi-label classification of 35 targets. Deep neural networks, including dense multilayer perceptrons and bidirectional LSTM architectures were also examined along with BERT transformer. Beyond classification, auxiliary analyses such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, along with Sentiment Analysis using VADER, and TextBlob provided interpretable insights into location, emotional tone, and emerging disaster themes. The integrated approach demonstrates that traditional vector-based models remain competitive for low-resource crisis text.
